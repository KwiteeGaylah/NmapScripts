# NmapScripts

There are two nmap scripts in this repository
1. Shell script (.sh)
2. Python3 script (.py)

They both perform nmap scanning automation, use your preferrd language.

The run the script is very simple. 
1. change the file permission : chmod +x <filename>
2. run the script: ./<filename> or bash <filename>

Happy Automation.
